## Expansion Goal

Move from "full ladder coverage" to "depth + breadth + transfer":

- Depth: add advanced specialization beyond 401.
- Breadth: add domains not yet represented in the catalog.
- Transfer: add interdisciplinary capstones that force cross-track reasoning.

## Proposed New Track Families

### Family A: Future Tech and Systems

- quantum-computing (101-401)
- ai-safety-alignment (101-401)
- distributed-systems (101-401)
- data-engineering (101-401)
- developer-tools-devops (101-401)

### Family B: Earth, Space, and Sustainability

- climate-science (101-401)
- oceanography (101-401)
- geoscience (101-401)
- space-missions-engineering (101-401)
- sustainability-policy (101-401)

### Family C: Health and Human Systems

- neuroscience (101-401)
- public-health (101-401)
- nutrition-science (101-401)
- mental-health-literacy (101-401)
- sports-science (101-401)

### Family D: Society, Law, and Global Competence

- comparative-politics (101-401)
- media-literacy (101-401)
- international-relations (101-401)
- negotiation-conflict-resolution (101-401)
- ethics-of-technology (101-401)

## Proposed Post-401 Specialization Layer

Introduce optional 501/601 modules for selected high-demand tracks:

- ai-machine-learning-501/601
- ai-workflows-501/601
- cloud-computing-501/601
- cybersecurity-501/601
- data-science-501/601
- biotechnology-501/601
- ux-design-501/601
- entrepreneurship-501/601

Design intent:

- 501 = specialist project implementation and field methods.
- 601 = research, leadership, governance, and publishable capstone.

## Interdisciplinary Capstone Proposals

- capstone-smart-city-systems:
  - integrates civics, cloud, data science, sustainability, and ux-design.
- capstone-human-health-ai:
  - integrates biology, psychology, medicine, ai-workflows, and ethics.
- capstone-climate-and-economy:
  - integrates climate-science, economics, policy, and systems modeling.
- capstone-media-and-democracy:
  - integrates media-literacy, us-civics, philosophy, and history.

Each capstone should include:

- one simulation-driven lesson,
- one policy or ethics debate,
- one data-analysis mini project,
- one implementation artifact and rubric-based defense.

## Assessment and Teaching Upgrades

- Add scenario-based benchmark assessments at end of each 201/301/401 level.
- Add "teach-back" lesson templates: learners explain concepts as mini-instructors.
- Add misconception libraries per track and automated remediation bundles.
- Add capstone rubrics aligned to explanation quality, rigor, and transfer.

## Suggested Delivery Order

### Wave 1 (Immediate)

- ai-safety-alignment
- data-engineering
- climate-science
- neuroscience
- media-literacy

### Wave 2

- distributed-systems
- public-health
- negotiation-conflict-resolution
- sustainability-policy
- ethics-of-technology

### Wave 3

- quantum-computing
- space-missions-engineering
- oceanography
- international-relations
- sports-science

## Acceptance Criteria for Expansion Completion

- Every new track has 101/201/301/401 sequence with quiz + interactive coverage.
- Each level has at least 6 lessons and at least 2 checkpoint assessments.
- Quality report average score remains >= 95 after expansion.
- Zero curriculum validation errors and zero warnings.
- Module-level gap report remains fully closed for existing tracks.
